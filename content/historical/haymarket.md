The Haymarket is a place, a city square, formerly an important market in Chicago. Its name is remembered because on May 4, 1886, a bomb was thrown at an [anarchist meeting](http://homicide.northwestern.edu/historical/movements/haymarket/). Police marched from the nearby Desplaines police station and fired upon the small crowd assembled, and seven police officers died, several more were wounded. A number of persons at the meeting were wounded and some may have died. The event occurred at a time of great tension over strikes and other conflicts involving the organization of labor.

The Haymarket Trial in 1886 and the hanging of four of the Haymarket defendants a year later were both the center of national attention. The judge, [Benjamin R. Magruder](/legal/judges/benjamindrakemagruder) who handed down the opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois in the Haymarket case was the Judge who wrote the opinion in [Ritchie v. People](/legal/court), the factory inspection case challenging the statute appointing Florence Kelley as Chief Factory Inspector.

When Illinois Governor [John Peter Altgeld](/historical/altgeld) pardoned the three Haymarket defendants who had not been executed he closed the door on his political future.
