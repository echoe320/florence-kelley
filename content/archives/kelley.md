1909 | [Kelley v. Wischnewetzky: Certificate of Evidence](1909. In March of 1892 Lazare Wischnewetzky brought a habeas corpus action against Florence Kelley Wischnewetzky seeking custody of his three children, Nicholas, Margaret, and John. This was a standard legal action for custody of children. Lazare Wischnewetzky and Florence Kelley Wischnewetzky were ineligible to seek a divorce in Illinois because neither had been resident in the state of Illinois for one year. The habeas corpus was heard by the Honorable Frank Baker of the Circuit Court of Cook County. Custody of the three children was awarded to the mother. These are the court documents from the 1892 legal proceeding..)
