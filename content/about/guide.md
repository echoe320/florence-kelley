### How to Use This Site

The Life and Times of Florence Kelley in Chicago, 1891-1899 is both a **web site** and document repository (**archive**). Three of the web site's sections - [Florence Kelley](/florence), [Historical Context](/historical) and [Legal Context](/legal) - provide a lens with which to examine the documents in the archive:

   [Florence Kelley](/florence/)
   Leign Bienen, Project Director, provides a series of vignettes of Florence Kelley's 9 years in Chicago. These provide extensive linkage to related material in the archive.

   [Historical Context](/historical)
   Strategic events and personalities in Chicago of the 1880's and 1890's interacted to produce a setting ripe for social change.

   [Legal Context](/legal)
   Biographies of mayors, judges, alderman (and a governor) give insight into the key legal and political figures of the day. Professor Bienen also describes 3 landmark court cases, Florence Kelley's factory inspection reports, and *The Law As Storyteller*.


#### Archives
Search the approximately 50,000 pages in the Archives using the [Search All Documents](/archives/search) tool; or search by  [Document Type](/archives/)  - e.g. government reports, factory inspection reports, newspaper articles, periodical articles, books, dissertations or correspondence.

**Note To Geneologists**
The Factory Inspection Reports and other documents here include the names and addresses of companies and many references to individuals.

**Viewing Documents**
The document browser window includes the document, a ***page-chapter indicator***, and a ***tool set***. 

The ***page-chapter indicator*** shows chapters (if the document has distinct chapters), a page dial (showing all the pages within the chapter or document), and standard forward and backward buttons:

Use the Close button (pper-right)  to exit the viewing window when finished.

The toolset - always positioned lower-right -  allows you to manipulate the image. By default it is set as a *zoom in* tool, but you can also *zoom out*, *rotate clockwise*, *rotate counter-clockwise*, *rotate randomly*, or *move* to different parts of the page:

#### Image Library
A library of several hundred photos is accessed with each page view. Some pages -e.g. [Lives of Children](/historical/children/) - have one or more specific images directly associated with them; others - e.g. [Johnny Powers](/legal/mayors/powers/) - select the image randomly. To view the image(s) click on the link below the thumbnail image; if more than one image is available in that particular gallery, use the forward button to scroll through them. Use the Close button to exit the viewing window when finished.
