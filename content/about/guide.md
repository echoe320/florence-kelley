### How to Use This Site

The Life and Times of Florence Kelley in Chicago, 1891-1899 is both a **web site** and document repository (**archive**). Three of the web site's sections - [Florence Kelley](/florence), [Historical Context](/historical) and [Legal Context](/legal) - provide a lens with which to examine the documents in the archive:

   [Florence Kelley](/florence/)
   Leign Bienen, Project Director, provides a series of vignettes of Florence Kelley's 9 years in Chicago. These provide extensive linkage to related material in the archive.

   [Historical Context](/historical/)
   Strategic events and personalities in Chicago of the 1880's and 1890's interacted to produce a setting ripe for social change.

   [Legal Context](/legal/)
   Biographies of mayors, judges, alderman (and a governor) give insight into the key legal and political figures of the day. Professor Bienen also describes 3 landmark court cases, Florence Kelley's factory inspection reports, and *The Law As Storyteller*.

   [Archives](/archives/)
   Browse the approximately 50,000 pages in the Archives by document type - e.g. government reports, factory inspection reports, newspaper articles, periodical articles, books, dissertations or correspondence. The documents are fully-downloadable.

**Note To Geneologists**
The Factory Inspection Reports and other documents here include the names and addresses of companies and many references to individuals.

#### Image Library
A library of several hundred photos is accessed with each page view. Some pages -e.g. [Lives of Children](/historical/children/) - have one or more specific images directly associated with them.
