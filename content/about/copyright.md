### Copyright

The creators of this web site exercised due diligence in seeking to identify copyright holders and, where necessary, to obtain permission for all copyrighted works included on this web site. If the original publisher no longer exists or could not be located, we assumed the author's heirs were the copyright holders, absent information to the contrary. Where permission from a known copyright holder was expressly granted, the party granting permission has been credited. 

When we sought but did not receive a response from a presumed copyright holder (where one was identified), a selection from the work was provisionally placed on the web site on the following basis: If and when the legitimate copyright holder contacts us, the copyright holder may either expressly approve inclusion of the work on the web site (in which case the copyright holder will be credited on the web site) or object to inclusion of the work on the web site (in which case, subject to the fair use doctrine, the work will not be included on the web site). Related inquiries from copyright holders should be addressed to this web site's [Editor]().
